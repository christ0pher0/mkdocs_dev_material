==Overview==

For media streaming, web hosting, and home automation, a homelab with 3-5 servers would be ideal. Here's a suggested setup:

1. Media Streaming Server: Dedicated to running applications like Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby to manage and stream your media files.
1. Web Hosting Server: Used for hosting websites, blogs, or web applications. You can run platforms like WordPress, Ghost, or static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll.
1. Home Automation Server: Focused on managing your smart home devices and automation tasks using Home Assistant or similar platforms.
1. Backup Server: Optional but recommended for storing backups of your data and ensuring redundancy.
1. Development/Testing Server: Optional for experimenting with new applications, services, or configurations without affecting your main setup.

This setup provides a good balance between functionality and manageability, allowing you to run multiple services efficiently.
