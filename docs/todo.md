# Homelab Todo & Roadmap
_Last updated: 2026-04-12_

---

## Critical / Security
- [ ] FreeNAS 2019 → TrueNAS Community Edition — EOL OS on 45TB of data
- [ ] **Deploy Zabbix** — proactive monitoring before failures hit
  - [ ] Zabbix server — deploy on Proxmox VM or docker-deb
  - [ ] Zabbix agent on every managed Linux host
  - [ ] ZFS plugin — monitor RAIDZ1 health, drive errors on FreeNAS ⚠️
  - [ ] Disk space alerts — eld D: (10%), amontillado D: (11%), pi1 SD (91%) ⚠️
  - [ ] RAM/CPU/temperature monitoring fleet-wide
  - [ ] Service health checks — mediastack containers, Plex jails
  - [ ] **Telegram alerts** — bot notifications when something looks wrong
  - [ ] Alert on: drive errors, disk >85%, service down, high temp, RAM pressure
### Backup Strategy (eld)
- [ ] Migrate eld to Ubuntu 26.04
- [ ] Deploy Restic — automated backups from FreeNAS (Tier 1)
- [ ] Configure 2x CRU bays on eld for rotating manual drives (Tier 2)
- [ ] Establish offsite drive rotation schedule (Tier 3)
- [ ] Expand backup coverage — currently only Patreon O-Z backed up, A-N missing
- [ ] Expand eld storage — 3TB internal nearly full (10% free)
- [ ] Upgrade eld RAM to 32GB DDR3 before migration

---

## In Progress
- [ ] Inventory 5 remaining waiting systems — match hardware to roles
- [ ] Inventory pve3 (ThinkStation offsite) — specs, storage, role
- [ ] Complete IP renumbering (Rocky/Alma/RHEL .51-.53 → .80-.82, Pis, TVs etc.)
- [ ] Remove alea_iacta_est (plex-plexpass_2) jail from FreeNAS — experimental, not needed
- [ ] Purchase Hologram.io SIM for argos-deb LTE
- [ ] Purchase larger SD card for pi1-deb (3.8GB, 91% full)
- [ ] Evaluate LambdaLabs workstation — potential multi-GPU AI node
- [ ] Deploy Gitea as Docker container — not dedicated Pi
- [ ] Pi rack — 3D print or buy, house all 8 Pis cleanly
- [ ] PoE switch + PoE HATs — single cable per Pi for power + network

### Hardware Inventory Completion
- [ ] Photo and dmidecode all 5 waiting systems
- [ ] Photo pve2 (Dell OptiPlex 7050)
- [ ] Photo pve3 (ThinkStation offsite)

## Planned Projects

### Local AI Assistant
- [ ] Deploy Ollama — local LLM backend on GPU node
- [ ] Deploy Open WebUI — chat interface with multi-model support
- [ ] Create sysadmin assistant — fed network context doc, knows the whole lab
- [ ] Create homelab advisor — planning and research personality
- [ ] Create casual assistant — general chat, different vibe
- [ ] Each character gets: name, avatar, system prompt, model
- [ ] Add Whisper — local speech to text
- [ ] Add Piper — local text to speech, multiple voice models
- [ ] Feed MkDocs docs as RAG knowledge base
- [ ] Feed Ansible inventory and playbooks as context

- [ ] Write Ansible playbook to rename fleet — hostname, /etc/hosts, inventory
- [ ] Change cos passwords fleet-wide
- [ ] Update DHCP reservations with new hostnames
- [ ] Update MkDocs documentation with new names

### Secrets & Identity
- [ ] Vaultwarden (Bitwarden) — self-hosted password manager

- [ ] Traefik — reverse proxy with auto HTTPS, Docker-native, replaces SWAG
- [ ] WireGuard — already running in mediastack, evaluate for wider use
- [ ] DDNS-Updater — if exposing services externally

### Documentation
- [ ] Verify network diagram rendering in MkDocs — check Mermaid/PlantUML plugin
- [ ] Create UML network diagram — all hosts, IPs, connections, VLANs
- [ ] Create Proxmox cluster diagram — VMs, LXCs, storage
- [ ] Create Pi fleet diagram — all 8 Pis, roles, connections
- [ ] Expand MkDocs site with Ansible playbook docs
- [ ] Document Docker Swarm setup
- [ ] Document Proxmox VM/LXC layout
- [ ] BookStack or Wiki.js — evaluate as MkDocs replacement for richer docs
